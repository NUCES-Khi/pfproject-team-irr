Project Title: Matrices Calculation Programme
 
Project Description: 
Our project aims to reinforce the core concepts and skills we have learned in the course by developing a Matrices Calculation Program. 

These core concepts include
1. Control Structures (If statements & If - Else Statements)
2. Switch Statements
3. Loops
4. Arrays (1D & 2D)
5. Functions
6. DMA
7. Filing 

Project Scope: 
This program will be created in C language, using the “Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022” as the compiler for our program as well as the interface for the program. The program will consist of:
1. Determinant of nxn Square Matrix
2. Addition & Subtraction between two Matrices. (mxn),
3. Multiplication of between two Matrices [(mxn)],
4. Transpose of a Matrix,
5. Convolution of a square Matrix

The program will offer the user the option to choose from the above-mentioned sub-programs that pertain to the use of matrices. For tedious inputs, we will utilize the functionality of filing and dynamic memory allocation. 

Project Proposal:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WgnxUlIsiaGoS_nAoRt0zmTTITkBRQu0Fad-QXwyOXM/edit?usp=sharing

Tasks completed:
1. Addition between two matrices. 
2. Subtraction between two matrices. 
3. Multiplication between two matrices. 
4. Transpose of a matrix
5. Determinant of a nxn matrix
6. Convolution of nxn matrix

Tasks to be done:
1. DMA and Filing needs to be used in matrices  
2. User Interface to be created for our calculator 
3. Functions to be created in some elements of the programme
